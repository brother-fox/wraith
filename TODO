Overall:
  1) tried --remove-pid/--remove-pidfile to remove pids of dysktd and nidusd
     from /var/run but does not work. Have to use --make-pid to force creation
     of pid file but then, the pidfile is not removed (ubuntu does not have
     --remove-pid flag
  2) run dyskt as root - requires too many workarounds otherwise
     o if daemon is run as root, will have to modify cmdline.dysktrunning to
     use sudo pwd
GUI:
 10) get log panel/tail log panels to scroll automatically
     o yview('moveto') does not work
 17) Help Panel
     o use a two-paned window for an indexed help
     o write help documentation
 20) Treeview/TabularPanel
     o Horizontal scrollbars on tree view do not work
     o Column widths are off a little (wider than desired)
 21) Have to work on resize of widgets etc with row/column configure
 22) use Tk validatecommand on widgets
 24) guisave/guiload only works on first sublevel i.e. children of the master panel
     should we extend to every panel or leave as is
 27) Splash panel
     o get rid of border around progressbar and progressbar.pbar
     o many statements are not even seen, remove them
 29) icons or status bar to show what state services are in??
 30) What is the best way to handle child panels and db connections?
     o psycopg2 claims excellent threaded cursors - do we use the main connection
       in WraithPanel and pass created cursors to children? -> have to trust the
       children to rollback on any errors
     o or do we create a new connection for each child that needs it?
 31) use postgresql listen/notify for updating data from tables
 34) look into Treeview virtual events Select,Open,Close to see if it is anything
     we can use
 35) implement query functionality, need a simplistic query language in xml or
     something
DySKT:
  3) implement adaptive scan pattern
 26) gps device handling
     o identify/handle device failing or being removed
     o uniquely identify with a permanent id
     o allow no gps (fixed or otherwise)
 41) need to handle tuner thread failure in rdoctl
 43) allow sensor to start in paused mode
 44) implement control socket
 45) rdoctl will block on socket if no wireless traffic is present -> put a timeout
     or something on it
 45) move bulk framing to RadioController to minimize internal traffic???
 46) After beginning adding of command socket, will hang occasionally on shutdown
 47) when dyskt hangs up on a connected socket, we get a bad file descriptor error
   Traceback (most recent call last):

    raise error(EBADF, 'Bad file descriptor')
  error: [Errno 9] Bad file descriptor
 48) odd behaviour with responses to client after commands are sent
 49) when tuner handles tokens from DySKT including commands, the tuner does
     not proceed to next channel
Nidus:
  1) return messages instead of just closing pipe for no running server etc
  2) need constraints either through postgresql (preferred) or nidusdb - one example
   for each flt inserted verify first that the ts is within the period defined for
   the corresponding sensor
  3) Optimize postgresql database, storage, retrieval, indexing etc
  4) identify postgresql server not running prior to request handler
  8) secured (hashed) username/password from/to datastore
 10) how/when to partition table to offload older records
 12) nidusdb.py
     o Save thread does not save last n frames to file
     o in SSE Threads handle errors in some way to notify nidusdb why
       - have started using a err variable in SSEThread class, must extend that
         to allow nidusdb to see the error
     o look into processes over threads for SSE
     o should we use nidusdb's connection or continue to create in the thread
 15) should we commit individual statements in long functions i.e. _setradio
 16) add radiotap extensions spatial streams
 17) look into PPI (per packet information)
 18) add trigger to reset sequences when tables are emptied
Radio:
 1) Should we add support for AVS, Prism headers ?
 2) radiotap: ensure data pad is handled for atheros cards (any others?)
 3) in mpdu, fully parse
    o control wrapper
    o +htc
    o info-elements
     - RSN Std 8.4.2.27, #48
     - TIM Info-Element #5 from beacons could be useful
     - parse timing advance
 5) how to support a-msdu etc
 6) 802.1X parsing as well as additional mpdu i.e. 802.11u, 802.11s etc
 7) compile/use own oui file, not relying on aircrack-ng
